/* Class = "UITextView"; text = "Physical Presence Calculator for Canadian PR & Citizenship\nVersion 2.0.2\nReleased August 20 2017\nDeveloped by Alex Zhang\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis app is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. While the developer is trying his best to make it accurate and reliable, the calculation result is for illustrative purpose only. The developer is not liable for any loss from using these data by any means.\n\nAn official web-based calculator for citizenship is available in CIC website. You are suggested to check the residence eligibility there as the authoritative and final measure when you intend to begin the application process.\n\nAbout\n\nThis app is a handy tool to calculate the physical presence in Canada and check, against the basic residence obligation stipulated by law, whether you are eligible by a specific date to apply for Permanent Residence Card renewal or Grant of Citizenship.\n\nThe basic residence requirements for PR status or PR Card renewal:\n\n1, For a resident to be eligible to renew Permanent Residence Card you must have been physically present in Canada for at least 730 days in the 5 years immediately before the date of your application.\n\n2, For the purpose of calculating the number of days to comply with the residency obligation, a day includes a full day or any part of a day that a permanent resident is physically present in Canada. Any part of a day spent in Canada is to be counted as one full day.\n\nThe basic residence requirements for Citizenship application:\n\n1, For a resident to be eligible to apply for Citizenship, you must have been physically present in Canada as a permanent resident for at least 1,095 days in the 5 years immediately before the date of your application.\n\n2, For the purpose of calculating the number of days of absence, neither the day you leave Canada nor the day you return is considered an absence. Both are counted as days of physical presence.\n\n3, Applicants may count each day they were physically present in Canada as a temporary resident or protected person before becoming a permanent resident as a half-day toward meeting the physical presence requirement for citizenship, up to a maximum credit of 365 days.\n\nTips\n\nIt’s generally self-explanatory to use this app. Here are a few definitions you may like to know.\n\n“Landing Date” is the first day when you became a Canadian permanent resident.\n\n“Total Presence” is the sum of days when you’ve been physically present in Canada during the period from the first day you entered Canada to the “Application Date” you specify. For Citizenship application, those physical presence before the “Landing Date” is counted as half of it.\n\n“Effective Presence” is the sum of days when you’ve been physically present in Canada during the 5 years period immediately before the “Application Date”.\n\n“Extra Days Required” is the minimum days which you need to stay continuously (without any absence) in Canada from the “Application Date” onwards in order to be eligible. It is not necessarily equal to the difference between the legally required days and your effective presence.\n\n“Earliest Date to Meet Obligation” is the forecast day when you will meet the residence obligation for your PR status query or PR card renewal if and when you will be staying continuously (without any absence) in Canada for “Extra Days” from the “Application Date” onwards. The time to apply for PR card renewal is not only governed by the residence obligation, it is also very much dependent upon the issue/expiry time of the existing card. CIC states if your PR card will expire within 6 months you should apply to renew your card. So the “Earliest Date to Meet Obligation” is not necessarily the “Earliest Date to Apply”.\n\n“Earliest Date to Apply” is the forecast day that you’re eligible to apply for Citizenship if and when you will be staying continuously (without any absence) in Canada for “Extra Days” from the “Application Date” onwards.\n\n“Application Date” is the day to sign and submit your application. You can specify a date to test if you are eligible on that day. For the PR card holder, it is useful to test your compliance with the residence requirement of “staying at least 2 in 5 years” immediately before any time in the future you’d like to enter Canada."; ObjectID = "4gA-QF-nhl"; */
